 Dokksusdfsfs

Docker powered mini-Heroku. The smallest PaaS implementation you've ever seen.

## Requirements

Assumes Ubuntu 13 right now. Ideally have a domain ready to point to your host. It's designed for and is probably
best to use a fresh VM. The bootstrapper will install everything it needs.

## Installing

    $ wget -qO- j.mp/dokku-bootstrap | bash

This may take around 5 minutes. Certainly better than the several hours it takes to bootstrap Cloud Foundry.

## Configuring

Set up a domain and a wildcard domain pointing to that host. Make sure `/home/git/DOMAIN` is set to this domain. 
By default it's set to whatever the hostname the host has.

You'll have to add a public key associated with a username as it says at the end of the bootstrapper. You'll do something
like this from your local machine:

    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh root@progriumapp.com "gitreceive upload-key progrium"

That's it!

## Deploy an App

Right now Buildstep supports the Node.js, Ruby, and Java buildpacks. It's not hard to add more, [go add more](https://github.com/progrium/buildstep#adding-buildpacks)! Let's deploy
the Heroku Node.js sample app. All you have to do is add a remote to name the app. It's created on-the-fly.

    $ cd node-js-sample
    $ git remote add progrium git@progriumapp.com:node-js-app
    $ git push progrium master

    ... blah blah blah ...
    
    remote: -----> Application deployed:
    remote:        http://node-js-app.progriumapp.com

You're done!

## Advanced installation (for development)

The bootstrap script allows source URLs to be overridden to include customizations from your own 
repositories. The GITRECEIVE_URL and DOKKU_REPO environment variables
may be set to override the defaults (see the bootstrap.sh script for how these apply). Example:

    $ wget j.mp/dokku-bootstrap
    $ chmod +x bootstrap.sh
    $ DOKKU_REPO=https://github.com/yourusername/dokku.git bootstrap.sh
    
## Upgrading

Dokku is in active development. You can update the deployment step and the build step separately.
To update the deploy step (this is updated less frequently):

    $ cd ~/dokku
    $ git pull origin master
    $ make install
    
More frequently, the build step is updated. This is where the app "stack" lives and where buildpacks
are supported. You can update this by running:

    $ cd ~/dokku/buildstep
    $ git pull origin master
    $ make build

Nothing needs to be restarted. Changes will take effect on the next push / deployment.

## Components

 * [Docker](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker) - Container runtime and manager
 * [Buildstep](https://github.com/progrium/buildstep) - Buildpack builder
 * [gitreceive](https://github.com/progrium/gitreceive) - Git push interface
 * [sshcommand](https://github.com/progrium/sshcommand) - Fixed commands over SSH

## Ideas for Improvements

 * Custom domain support for apps
 * HTTPS support on default domain
 * Support more buildpacks (see Buildstep)
 * Use dokku as the system user instead of git
 * Heroku-ish commands to be run via SSH (like [Dokuen](https://github.com/peterkeen/dokuen#available-app-sub-commands))

Looking to keep codebase as simple and hackable as possible, so try to keep your line count down.

## Things this project won't do

 * **Multi-host.** Not a huge leap, but this isn't the project for it. Maybe as Super Dokku.
 * **Multitenancy.** It's ready for it, but again, probably for Super Dokku.
 * **Client app.** Given the constraints, running commands remotely via SSH is fine.
